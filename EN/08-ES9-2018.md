# ES9-2018 Questions

## Asynchronous Iteration Loop

### 1. How can you use `for-await-of` to iterate over asynchronous data, and what are the benefits of this feature?
In ES9, a new feature called `for-await-of` was introduced, allowing you to iterate over data that is produced asynchronously. This loop works similarly to `for-of`, except it's specifically designed for working with `Promises`. This feature is particularly useful when you need to wait for several asynchronous operations to complete, like fetching data from an API or database, and you want to process the results one by one.

```javascript
async function* asyncGenerator() {
    yield 'Hello';
    yield 'World';
}

(async () => {
    for await (const value of asyncGenerator()) {
        console.log(value); // Logs each value
    }
    // Output:
    // Hello
    // World
})();
```

In this example, an asynchronous function (`asyncGenerator`) is used to generate data. Then, `for-await-of` retrieves and prints the data one by one. This feature lets you efficiently manage asynchronous data and ensures each piece of data is fully received before processing it.

## `Promise.prototype.finally` Method

### 2. How can the `finally` method improve `Promise` management, and what are its use cases?
The `finally` method was added to `Promises` to ensure that a piece of code runs after a `Promise` is completed, whether it was successful or failed. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform a specific task, such as cleanup or updating the user interface, after an operation finishes, regardless of its outcome.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error))
    .finally(() => console.log('Request finished')); // This code always runs
```

In this example, `finally` ensures that the message "Request finished" is displayed after the request is completed, whether it was successful or not. This feature helps you ensure that final tasks, such as hiding a loading indicator or releasing resources, are always performed.

## Object Rest Properties

### 3. How can you use `Object Rest` properties to extract specific parts of an object, and what are the use cases for this feature?
In ES9, `Rest` properties, previously used with arrays, were extended to objects. This feature allows you to extract certain properties from an object while keeping the remaining properties in a new object. This capability is especially useful when you want to remove unnecessary or less important parts from an object and keep only the properties you need.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const { a, ...rest } = obj;

console.log(rest); // { b: 2, c: 3 }
```

In this example, the property `a` is separated from the original object, and the remaining properties are stored in a new object called `rest`. This feature helps you easily separate extra data from objects and keep only the information you need.

## New RegExp Features

### 4. What new features were introduced for `RegExp`, and how can they improve working with regular expressions?
In ES9, several new features were added to `RegExp` to make working with regular expressions simpler and more powerful. These features include named capture groups, lookbehind assertions, and the `s` flag, also known as dotAll. These capabilities allow you to create and manage more complex patterns with greater flexibility.

- **Named Capture Groups:** Allow you to assign a name to matched groups for easier access.
- **Lookbehind Assertions:** Enable you to match a pattern only if it is preceded by a specific pattern.
- **`s` flag (dotAll):** Makes the dot (`.`) in regular expressions match any character, including newline characters.

```javascript
// Named Capture Groups
const regExp = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/;
const match = regExp.exec('2024-08-12');
console.log(match.groups.year); // 2024

// Lookbehind Assertions
const lookbehindRegExp = /(?<=\$)\d+/;
console.log(lookbehindRegExp.exec('$100')[0]); // 100

// dotAll flag
const dotAllRegExp = /foo.bar/s;
console.log(dotAllRegExp.test('foo\nbar')); // true
```

In these examples, new `RegExp` features like named capture groups, lookbehind assertions, and the `s` flag are used to create more robust and flexible regular expressions. These features help you match more complex patterns and process data more precisely.

## Shared Memory in JavaScript

### 5. How does shared memory work in JavaScript, and what are its applications?
In ES9, support for shared memory using `SharedArrayBuffer` and atomic operations with `Atomics` was added to JavaScript. These features allow you to safely share data between multiple threads or web workers and perform operations that execute atomically without interruption. This capability is particularly useful in applications that require parallel processing or when you want to prevent data races.

```javascript
const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024); // Create a shared buffer
const uint8 = new Uint8Array(buffer); // Create a typed array to access the buffer

Atomics.add(uint8, 0, 10); // Atomically add 10 to the first element
console.log(Atomics.load(uint8, 0)); // 10
```

In this example, a `SharedArrayBuffer` of 1024 bytes is created, and then a `Uint8Array` is created to access this buffer. Using `Atomics.add`, an atomic operation is performed, ensuring no other thread interferes in the middle of the operation and changes the values. These features help you manage parallel operations safely and efficiently.

## `Promise.any` Method

### 1. How does `Promise.any` work, and when is it useful?
The `Promise.any` method lets you pick the first `Promise` that successfully resolves out of a bunch. Instead of waiting for all the `Promise`s to finish, you just use the first one that comes back with a result. This is super handy when you've started a few tasks at the same time and only care about whichever one finishes first.

```javascript
const myPromise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 200, "King");
});

const myPromise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Queen");
});

Promise.any([myPromise1, myPromise2]).then((result) => {
  console.log(result); // "Queen"
});
```

In this example, `Promise.any` waits for one of the two `Promise`s to complete successfully and returns the first result, which is "Queen". This feature is especially useful when you want to get the fastest response from multiple simultaneous operations and don't care about the rest.

## `replaceAll` Method

### 2. How does the `replaceAll` method help with text replacement in strings?
The `replaceAll` method allows you to replace all occurrences of a word or phrase in a string with another word or phrase. Unlike `replace`, which only changes the first match, `replaceAll` changes every match. This method is super helpful when you want to make a complete change in a text and don't want to miss anything.

```javascript
let text = "Cats are great. Cats are friendly.";
text = text.replaceAll("Cats", "Dogs");
console.log(text); // "Dogs are great. Dogs are friendly."
```

Here, `replaceAll` replaces all instances of "Cats" with "Dogs". This method is especially useful when you want to make a comprehensive change to a phrase in a text without having to manually do it multiple times.

Additionally, you can use `replaceAll` with regular expressions to find and replace more complex matches in text. Just remember to use the `g` (global) flag.

```javascript
let text = "Cats are great. Cats are friendly.";
text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g, "Dogs");
console.log(text); // "Dogs are great. Dogs are friendly."
```

This approach helps you apply all necessary changes to the text with just one line of code.

## Numeric Separators

### 3. What are numeric separators (`_`), and how can you use them?
Numeric separators (`_`) let you write large numbers in your code in a more readable way. These separators don't affect the actual value of the number, but they make reading and understanding large numbers easier. This is especially helpful when working with numbers in the millions or billions, reducing reading and writing errors.

```javascript
const num = 1_000_000_000;
console.log(num); // 1000000000
```

Here, the `_` separators make the number easier to read, but the result is still 1000000000. These separators only improve code readability, and you can place them anywhere in the number to make it easier to read.

```javascript
const num1 = 1_234_567_890_123_456;
console.log(num1); // 1234567890123456
```

This feature is particularly useful when you're working with large and complex numbers and want to ensure the code is both readable and low on errors.

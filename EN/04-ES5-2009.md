# ES5-2009 Questions

## "use strict" in JavaScript

### 1. Why do we use "use strict," and what are its benefits?
Using "use strict" makes JavaScript code run in "strict mode." This mode helps you write cleaner code with fewer errors, like preventing the use of undeclared variables. "use strict" is just a string expression, and if the browser doesn't recognize it, it won't throw an error.

```javascript
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

In this example, because we used "use strict," if a variable is defined without `var`, `let`, or `const`, it throws an error. This helps prevent common mistakes.

## Accessing String Characters Using Indexes

### 2. How can we access characters of a string using indexes?
Besides the `charAt` method, which was used to access string characters, you can also access string characters using indexes, similar to how you access elements in an array.

```javascript
var str = "HELLO WORLD";
console.log(str.charAt(0)); // 'H'
console.log(str[0]);        // 'H'
```

This method of accessing characters might not work correctly in some older browsers, but it works fine in modern browsers.

## Multi-line Strings

### 3. How can we write multi-line strings?
You can create multi-line strings using a backslash `\`.

```javascript
var str = "Hello \
Dolly!";
```

This method might not work properly in all browsers. A safer way to write multi-line strings is by using string concatenation.

```javascript
var str = "Hello " + 
"Dolly!";
```

## Using Reserved Words as Property Names

### 4. Can we use reserved words as property names?
Yes, in ES5, you are allowed to use reserved words as property names.

```javascript
var obj = {name: "John", new: "yes"};
```

This feature lets you use more words as property names.

## String.trim Method

### 5. How does the trim method work?
The `trim` method removes whitespace from both sides of a string.

```javascript
var str = "       Hello World!        ";
console.log(str.trim()); // 'Hello World!'
```

This method helps you remove unnecessary whitespace from strings.

## Array.isArray Method

### 6. How can we check if an object is an array?
The `Array.isArray` method checks whether an object is an array or not.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log(Array.isArray(fruits)); // true
```

This method is particularly useful when you need to know the type of data you are working with.

## Array.forEach Method

### 7. How does the forEach method work?
The `forEach` method calls a function for each element in an array.

```javascript
var txt = "";
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
numbers.forEach(function(value) {
  txt += value + "<br>";
});
console.log(txt);
```

This method helps you easily loop through array elements and perform operations on each element.

## Array.map Method

### 8. How does the map method work, and what is its use?
The `map` method executes a function for each element in an array and returns a new array with the results.

```javascript
var numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var numbers2 = numbers1.map(function(value) {
  return value * 2;
});
console.log(numbers2); // [90, 8, 18, 32, 50]
```

This method is useful when you need to create a new array with modifications to the elements of the original array.

## Array.filter Method

### 9. How does the filter method work, and what is its use?
The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var over18 = numbers.filter(function(value) {
  return value > 18;
});
console.log(over18); // [45, 25]
```

This method helps you create a new array that only includes elements that meet a specific condition.

## Array.reduce Method

### 10. How does the reduce method work, and what is its use?
The `reduce` method reduces all elements in an array to a single value.

```javascript
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var sum = numbers.reduce(function(total, value) {
  return total + value;
});
console.log(sum); // 99
```

This method helps you calculate values like the total sum of all elements.

## Array.reduceRight Method

### 11. How does the reduceRight method work, and how is it different from reduce?
The `reduceRight` method works similarly to `reduce`, but it processes the array elements from right to left.

```javascript
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var sum = numbers.reduceRight(function(total, value) {
  return total + value;
});
console.log(sum); // 99
```

This method is useful when you need to perform a reduction operation starting from the end of the array.

## Array.every Method

### 12. How does the every method work, and what is its use?
The `every` method checks whether all elements in an array satisfy a specific condition.

```javascript
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var allOver18 = numbers.every(function(value) {
  return value > 18;
});
console.log(allOver18); // false
```

This method is useful when you need to ensure all elements meet a specific condition.

## Array.some Method

### 13. How does the some method work, and what is its use?
The `some` method checks whether at least one element in an array meets a specific condition.

```javascript
var numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
var someOver18 = numbers.some(function(value) {
  return value > 18;
});
console.log(someOver18); // true
```

This method is especially useful when you need to check if at least one element meets a specific condition.

## Array.indexOf Method

### 14. How can we find the position of an element in an array using indexOf?
The `indexOf` method returns the position of the first matching element in an array.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
var index = fruits.indexOf("Apple");
console.log(index); // 0
```

This method is handy when you need to find the position of a specific element.

## Array.lastIndexOf Method

### 15. How does the lastIndexOf method work, and how is it different from indexOf?
The `lastIndexOf` method works similarly to `indexOf`, but it starts searching from the end of the array.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
var index = fruits.lastIndexOf("Apple");
console.log(index); // 2
```

This method is useful when you need to find the position of the last matching element.

## JSON.parse Method

### 16. How does the JSON.parse method work, and what is its use?
The `JSON.parse` method is used to convert a JSON text string into a JavaScript object.

```javascript
var jsonString = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}';
var obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // 'John'
```

This method is particularly useful when you receive JSON data from a server and need to work with it as a JavaScript object.

## JSON.stringify Method

### 17. How does the JSON.stringify method work, and what is its use?
The `JSON.stringify` method is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

```javascript
var obj = {name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York"};
var jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString); // '{"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}'
```

This method is particularly useful when you need to send data to a server as a JSON string.

## Date.now Method

### 18. How does the Date.now method work, and what is its use?
The `Date.now` method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

```javascript
var timeInMs = Date.now();
console.log(timeInMs);
```

This method is useful for time and date calculations, such as calculating how long an operation took.

## Date.toISOString Method

### 19. How does the toISOString method work, and what is its use?
The `toISOString` method is used to convert a `Date` object to a string in the standard ISO format.

```javascript
var d = new Date();
console.log(d.toISOString());
```

This method is useful when you need to convert a date to a portable and standard format.

## Date.toJSON Method

### 20. How does the toJSON method work, and what is its use?
The `toJSON` method converts a `Date` object to a string in JSON format. The JSON format for

 dates is similar to the ISO-8601 standard.

```javascript
var d = new Date();
console.log(d.toJSON());
```

This method is particularly useful when you need to prepare a date in JSON format for data transfer.

## Using Getters and Setters

### 21. How do getters and setters work, and what are they used for?
ES5 allows you to define object methods that look like getting or setting a property.

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  get fullName() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName); // 'John Doe'
```

This example creates a getter for the `fullName` property that returns the full name.

## Object.defineProperty Method

### 22. How does the Object.defineProperty method work, and what is its use?
The `Object.defineProperty` method allows you to define or modify a property on an object.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
};

Object.defineProperty(person, "language", {
  value: "EN",
  writable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true
});

console.log(person.language); // 'EN'
```

This method is useful when you need more control over an object's properties, such as specifying whether a property is writable or enumerable.

## Object.create Method

### 23. How does the Object.create method work, and what is its use?
The `Object.create` method is used to create a new object from an existing object.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};

const man = Object.create(person);
man.firstName = "Peter";
console.log(man.firstName); // 'Peter'
console.log(man.lastName); // 'Doe'
```

This method is particularly useful when you need to create a new object from an existing prototype.

## Object.keys Method

### 24. How does the Object.keys method work, and what is its use?
The `Object.keys` method returns an array containing the keys of an object.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

const keys = Object.keys(person);
console.log(keys); // ['firstName', 'lastName', 'age', 'eyeColor']
```

This method is useful when you need to access the keys of an object.

## Function.bind Method

### 25. How does the bind method work, and what is its use?
The `bind` method allows an object to borrow a method from another object.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

const member = {
  firstName: "Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
};

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
console.log(fullName()); // 'Hege Nilsen'
```

This method is particularly useful when you need to bind a method to a specific object.

## Trailing Commas

### 26. How can we use trailing commas in object and array definitions?
ES5 allows you to use trailing commas in object and array definitions.

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 46,
};

var points = [
  1,
  5,
  10,
  25,
  40,
  100,
];
```

This feature helps improve readability and keeps the code cleaner, but keep in mind that JSON does not accept trailing commas.

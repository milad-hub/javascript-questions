# ES7-2016 Questions

## Exponentiation Operator in JavaScript

### 1. How does the Exponentiation Operator (`**`) work in JavaScript, and what are its uses?
In ES7, a new operator called `**` was introduced, which lets you easily raise a number to the power of another number. This operator is a simpler and more straightforward replacement for the `Math.pow` function, making it easier to write code related to powers.

```javascript
const result = 2 ** 3; // 2 raised to the power of 3
console.log(result); // 8
```

In this example, `2 ** 3` is calculated, and the result is 8. This operator makes writing exponents in JavaScript easier and the code more concise. This feature is particularly efficient in complex mathematical calculations that involve multiple exponents.

## Exponentiation Assignment Operator

### 2. How does the Exponentiation Assignment Operator (`**=`) work, and what are its advantages?
Along with the introduction of the `**` operator in ES7, the `**=` operator was also added, allowing you to raise a number to the power of another number and assign the result to the same variable. This operator works just like `+=` or `*=`, making code writing even simpler than before.

```javascript
let num = 4;
num **= 2; // 4 raised to the power of 2
console.log(num); // 16
```

In this example, the initial value of `num` is 4, and after using `**=`, this value changes to 16 because 4 to the power of 2 is calculated. This operator is very useful and concise when you want to directly assign the result of an exponentiation operation to the same variable.

## `Array.includes` Method

### 3. What is the `Array.includes` method in JavaScript, and how is it used?
In ES7, a new method called `includes` was added to arrays, allowing you to easily check whether a specific element is in an array. Unlike `indexOf`, which returns the index, this method returns a Boolean value (true or false), making it much quicker and easier to check if an element exists.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(arr.includes(2)); // true
console.log(arr.includes(5)); // false
```

In this example, `arr.includes(2)` returns `true` because the number 2 is present in the array, while `arr.includes(5)` returns `false` because the number 5 is not in the array. This method is very helpful when you need a quick and simple check to see if an element exists in an array, making the code cleaner and more readable.

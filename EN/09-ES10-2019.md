# ES10-2019 Questions

## `String.prototype.trimStart` and `String.prototype.trimEnd` Methods

### 1. How can you manage whitespace at the start and end of strings using `trimStart` and `trimEnd`?
In ES10, two new methods, `trimStart` and `trimEnd`, were added to JavaScript, allowing developers to specifically remove whitespace from the beginning or end of strings. These methods are more specific versions of the `trim` method, which removes whitespace from both sides. With these, you can choose exactly which side of the string should be trimmed.

```javascript
const str = '   Hello World!   ';
console.log(str.trimStart()); // 'Hello World!   '
console.log(str.trimEnd()); // '   Hello World!'
```

In this example, `trimStart` removes the whitespace from the beginning, and `trimEnd` removes it from the end of the string. This feature is particularly useful for cleaning up strings in user inputs or data received from different sources.

## `Object.fromEntries` Method

### 2. What is the purpose of the `Object.fromEntries` method, and how can it help manage data?
In ES10, the `Object.fromEntries` method was introduced, allowing you to easily convert an array of key-value pairs into an object. This method complements `Object.entries`, which converts an object into an array of key-value pairs. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with structured data like JSON.

```javascript
const entries = [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]];
const obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(obj); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

In this example, an array of key-value pairs is converted into an object using `Object.fromEntries`. This method helps you quickly convert data in arrays into object structures, making it easier to process and access.

## Optional Catch Binding

### 3. How does the `Optional Catch Binding` feature help simplify error handling?
In ES10, a new feature called `Optional Catch Binding` was introduced, allowing you to omit the error parameter in `catch` blocks if you don't need it. This feature is especially useful when you just want to handle errors without needing to process their details.

```javascript
try {
    // some code
} catch {
    console.log('An error occurred.');
}
```

In this example, the error parameter is omitted in the `catch` block because we don't need to inspect the error details. This approach makes the code simpler and more readable, allowing you to focus only on the main parts of your code.

## `Array.prototype.flat` and `Array.prototype.flatMap` Methods

### 4. How can you use `flat` and `flatMap` to convert multi-dimensional arrays into simpler arrays?
In ES10, the `flat` and `flatMap` methods were added to JavaScript, allowing you to flatten multi-dimensional arrays into simpler ones. `flat` does this by removing nested layers, while `flatMap` lets you first map each element to a new array and then flatten the result.

```javascript
const arr = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
console.log(arr.flat(2)); // [1, 2, 3, [4]]

const arr2 = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr2.flatMap(x => [x, x * 2])); // [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]
```

In this example, `flat` converts a multi-layered array into a simpler array, while `flatMap` allows you to map each element to a new array and then flatten the result. These methods are particularly useful for managing complex and multi-layered data.

## Revised `Array.sort` Feature

### 5. How does the `Revised Array.sort` feature help improve data sorting?
In ES10, the `sort` method was revised to guarantee stable sorting. This means that when two elements in an array have the same value, their original order is preserved and does not change during sorting. This feature is especially important for sorting data where the original order matters.

```javascript
const arr = [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 22 }, { name: 'Jack', age: 25 }];
arr.sort((a, b) => a.age - b.age);
console.log(arr);
/* Output:
[
  { name: 'Jane', age: 22 },
  { name: 'John', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Jack', age: 25 }
]
*/
```

In this example, the original order of elements with the same age (like John and Jack) is preserved during sorting. This feature helps you sort data without worrying about changing the original order.

## Revised `JSON.stringify` Feature

### 6. How do the improved features in `JSON.stringify` help prevent errors?
In ES10, `JSON.stringify` was revised to always produce valid Unicode strings. This change fixes problems that previously occurred when dealing with specific Unicode characters, ensuring that the generated strings are always correctly parsed.

```javascript
const str = '\uD800';
console.log(JSON.stringify(str)); // '"\\ud800"' instead of a malformed string
```

In this example, `JSON.stringify` correctly converts a string containing a malformed Unicode character and produces a valid string. This feature is especially useful for working with international text data and preventing errors related to data parsing.

## Use of Separators in String Literals

### 7. How can you use separators in string literals to make JSON a full superset of ECMAScript?
In ES10, the ability to use line separators (`\u2028`) and paragraph separators (`\u2029`) in string literals was introduced. This feature makes JSON a full superset of ECMAScript, creating more compatibility between string literals and JSON.

```javascript
const str = 'Hello\u2028World';
console.log(JSON.parse(`"${str}"`)); // 'Helloâ€¨World'
```

In this example, the line separator (`\u2028`) is correctly used in the string, and JSON parses it without any issues. This feature is very useful for working with text data from various sources that need specific formatting.

## Revised `Function.prototype.toString` Method

### 8. What are the benefits of the revised `Function.prototype.toString` method, and how can it help analyze code?
In ES10, the `Function.prototype.toString` method was revised to return the exact source code text of the function. This text includes everything, such as comments and whitespace, which helps with more precise analysis and debugging.

```javascript
function example() {
    // This is a comment
    return "Hello, world!";
}

console.log(example.toString());
/* Output:
function example() {
    // This is a comment
    return "Hello, world!";
}
*/
```

In this example, the `toString` method returns the code of the `example` function exactly as it was written, including all details like comments and whitespace. This feature helps you examine and analyze the code accurately, and it is also very useful when you need to document or transfer code to different environments.

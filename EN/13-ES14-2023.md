# ES14-2023 Questions

## `Array.findLast` Method

### 1. How does the `findLast` method work in arrays, and what is its use?
The `findLast` method is a new addition to arrays that allows you to start from the end of an array and find the first element that matches a certain condition. This method works similarly to `find`, but instead of starting from the beginning of the array, it starts from the end. This is especially useful when you want to start searching from the end and find the first match.

```javascript
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let high = temp.findLast(x => x > 40);
console.log(high); // 42
```

In this example, `findLast` starts from the end of the array and finds the first value greater than 40, which is 42. This method is great when you need the last match for a specific condition.

## `Array.findLastIndex` Method

### 2. What does the `findLastIndex` method do, and how can it optimize searches in arrays?
The `findLastIndex` method is similar to `findLast`, but instead of returning the value, it returns the index (position) of the last element that meets a certain condition. This method is useful when you want to know where a specific condition was last met in the array.

```javascript
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let pos = temp.findLastIndex(x => x > 40);
console.log(pos); // 4
```

In this example, `findLastIndex` finds the last position where a value greater than 40 exists, which is index 4 (value 42). This method is useful for optimizing searches and finding the location of the last match.

## `Array.toReversed` Method

### 3. How is `toReversed` different from `reverse`, and why is it better to use?
The `toReversed` method is a new and safer way to reverse arrays that returns a new array without modifying the original one. Unlike `reverse`, which directly changed the original array, `toReversed` keeps the original array unchanged and returns a reversed copy.

```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const reversed = months.toReversed();
console.log(reversed); // ["Apr", "Mar", "Feb", "Jan"]
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"]
```

In this example, `toReversed` returns a reversed version of the `months` array without altering the original array. This method is useful when you need to reverse an array but don't want the original array to change.

## `Array.toSorted` Method

### 4. How does `toSorted` help with sorting arrays, and why is it better than using `sort`?
The `toSorted` method is a new way to sort arrays that returns a sorted copy of the array without modifying the original one. This method works like `sort`, but its advantage is that it keeps the original array intact.

```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const sorted = months.toSorted();
console.log(sorted); // ["Apr", "Feb", "Jan", "Mar"]
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"]
```

In this example, `toSorted` returns a sorted array without changing the original one. This method is ideal when you need to sort but don't want the original array to be altered.

## `Array.toSpliced` Method

### 5. How can `toSpliced` be useful in manipulating arrays, and how does it differ from `splice`?
The `toSpliced` method is a new and safe way to remove or replace elements in an array that returns a modified copy without altering the original array. This method is a better alternative to `splice` because `splice` would change the original array, but `toSpliced` does not.

```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const spliced = months.toSpliced(0, 1);
console.log(spliced); // ["Feb", "Mar", "Apr"]
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"]
```

In this example, `toSpliced` returns a new version of the `months` array with the first element removed. The original array remains unchanged. This method is great for when you want to make changes to an array but keep the original intact.

## `Array.with` Method

### 6. How does the `with` method work, and what is its use in updating array elements?
The `with` method is a new way to replace elements in an array that returns a new version of the array with the specified element replaced, without modifying the original array. This method is useful for updating specific elements in an array without changing the rest of the array.

```javascript
const months = ["Januar", "Februar", "Mar", "April"];
const updated = months.with(2, "March");
console.log(updated); // ["Januar", "Februar", "March", "April"]
console.log(months); // ["Januar", "Februar", "Mar", "April"]
```

In this example, `with` returns a new version of the `months` array where the third element ("Mar") is replaced with "March". This allows you to easily update the array without changing the original one.

## `#!` (Shebang) Feature

### 7. What role does the `#!` (Shebang) feature play in executing JavaScript scripts, and why is it important to use?
The `#!` feature, also known as Shebang, is added to script files to tell the operating system which interpreter should be used to run the file. This feature is particularly useful when you want to run JavaScript code directly in Unix or Linux environments.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log('Hello World');
```

In this example, the `#!` indicates that the script should be executed with `node`. This allows you to run JavaScript code directly with `./fileName.js` instead of using `node fileName.js`. This feature helps manage and execute scripts more easily in different environments.

# ES11-2020 Questions

## BigInt Feature

### 1. Why was `BigInt` added to JavaScript, and what are its uses?
The `BigInt` data type was added to JavaScript so you can work with really large integers without losing precision in calculations. This is particularly useful when you need to handle numbers much larger than the range that `Number` (which uses 64-bit) can handle. `BigInt` allows you to manage numbers larger than 2^53-1 (the largest integer representable in `Number`) with full accuracy.

```javascript
const bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);
const anotherBigNumber = 9007199254740991n; // You can also create a BigInt by adding 'n' at the end of the number
console.log(bigNumber + anotherBigNumber); // 18014398509481982n
```

In this example, two large numbers are defined using `BigInt` and added together without losing precision. This feature is great for financial or scientific calculations where you need to handle very large numbers accurately.

## String.prototype.matchAll Method

### 2. What problems does the `matchAll` method solve, and how can you use it?
The `matchAll` method was added to JavaScript to let you find all matches of a regular expression in a string and get detailed information about them. Previously, you had to use more complex methods or nested loops to do this, but now `matchAll` returns all matches as an iterator, making access to them much easier.

```javascript
const regex = /t(e)(st(\d?))/g;
const str = 'test1test2';
const matches = [...str.matchAll(regex)];

console.log(matches[0]);
// Output:
// ["test1", "e", "st1", "1"]

console.log(matches[1]);
// Output:
// ["test2", "e", "st2", "2"]
```

In this example, `matchAll` finds all matches of the regular expression `regex` in the string `str` and returns them as an array of results. This feature is handy for working with texts that require precise processing, such as extracting data from documents or analyzing strings.

## Nullish Coalescing Operator

### 3. How can the `Nullish Coalescing` operator make your code more robust?
The `??` operator, known as `Nullish Coalescing`, lets you safely assign a default value to a variable when it is `null` or `undefined`. This operator is particularly useful when variables may come from external sources and may not have a value, helping to prevent unexpected errors.

```javascript
const foo = null ?? 'default';
const bar = 0 ?? 'default';

console.log(foo); // 'default'
console.log(bar); // 0
```

In this example, `foo` gets the default value 'default' because it is `null`, but `bar` keeps its value of `0` since it is a valid value. This operator is especially useful when you want to ensure variables have safe default values.

## Optional Chaining Operator

### 4. How does the `Optional Chaining` operator help prevent errors?
The `?.` operator, known as `Optional Chaining`, allows you to access properties or methods in a chain without worrying about whether they exist or not. This operator prevents `undefined` or `null` errors and makes your code more stable.

```javascript
const user = {
    profile: {
        name: 'John'
    }
};

const userName = user?.profile?.name;
const userAge = user?.profile?.age;

console.log(userName); // 'John'
console.log(userAge); // undefined (no error)
```

In this example, we safely access the `profile` and `name` properties using `?.`. If any of these properties do not exist, instead of throwing an error, it returns `undefined`, allowing the code to continue running smoothly.

## Logical AND Assignment Operator

### 5. When is the `Logical AND Assignment` operator useful, and how does it work?
The `&&=` operator, introduced in ES11, lets you assign a value to a variable only if the current value of that variable is `true`. This operator is especially useful when you want to conditionally change a value without writing the entire condition.

```javascript
let x = true;
let y = false;

x &&= 'Assigned if true';
y &&= 'Not assigned because false';

console.log(x); // 'Assigned if true'
console.log(y); // false
```

In this example, the value of `x` changes because it is `true`, but the value of `y`, which is `false`, remains unchanged. This operator can simplify writing complex conditions in your code and make it more readable.

## Logical OR Assignment Operator

### 6. How can the `Logical OR Assignment` operator simplify conditions?
The `||=` operator allows you to assign a value to a variable only if the current value of that variable is `false`, `null`, or `undefined`. This operator is especially useful when you want to assign a default value to a variable that might not have been initialized yet.

```javascript
let a = null;
let b = 'Already set';

a ||= 'Set because null';
b ||= 'Not set because already has a value';

console.log(a); // 'Set because null'
console.log(b); // 'Already set'
```

In this example, `a` gets a new value because it is `null`, but `b`, which already has a value, keeps it. This operator helps you write simpler conditions and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Nullish Coalescing Assignment Operator

### 7. What sets the `Nullish Coalescing Assignment` operator apart from other assignment operators?
The `??=` operator lets you assign a value to a variable only if its current value is `null` or `undefined`. This operator is particularly useful when you want to ensure a variable is initialized but don't want to overwrite `false` or `0` values.

```javascript
let c = null;
let d = 'Already defined';

c ??= 'Set because null';
d ??= 'Not set because already defined';

console.log(c); // 'Set because null'
console.log(d); // 'Already defined'
```

In this example, `c` is replaced with a new value because it is `null`, but `d`, which has a valid value, remains unchanged. This operator helps you perform safer default assignments.

## Promise.allSettled Method

### 8. What is the purpose of the `Promise.allSettled` method, and how can it help manage promises?
The `Promise.allSettled` method allows you to wait for all promises, whether they succeed or fail, to complete and then review the final outcome of each one. This method is particularly useful when you want to receive all results and not just focus on successful or failed ones.

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('Resolved');
const promise2 = Promise.reject('Rejected');
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000, 'Delayed'));

Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
    .then((results) => results.forEach((result) => console.log(result.status)));
/* Output:
fulfilled
rejected
fulfilled
*/
```

In this example, `Promise.allSettled` waits for all three promises to complete, whether successful or not, and then logs the final status of each. This method is useful when you want to know the status of all promises and handle all outcomes, whether successful or unsuccessful.

## Dynamic Import Feature

### 9. How can the `Dynamic Import` feature help optimize code loading?
The `Dynamic Import` feature allows you to load modules dynamically only when needed. This reduces the initial page or app load and ensures that other parts are only loaded when really needed. This feature helps optimize performance and reduce load times.

```javascript
// Suppose we have a module named 'math.js' containing various functions
async function loadMathModule() {
    const math = await import('./math.js');
    console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Using the add function from the math module
}

loadMathModule();
```

In this example, the `math.js` module is only loaded when needed (inside the `loadMathModule` function). This reduces the initial page or app load and ensures that the user only downloads the modules they really need. This feature is very useful for optimizing the performance of web applications and reducing page load times.

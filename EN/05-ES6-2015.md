# ES6-2015 Questions

## `let` Keyword in JavaScript

### 1. Why was `let` added to JavaScript, and what advantages does it have over `var`?
The `let` keyword was added to JavaScript to fix some of the limitations of the `var` keyword. When using `var` to define variables, their scope was limited to the entire function (or globally to the whole script). This could create a lot of issues, like if a variable inside a block of code was accidentally overwritten, it could cause unexpected errors.

With `let`, variables are only valid within the block they were defined in (like within `{}`), and they aren't accessible outside of that block. This makes it easier to manage variables and prevents problems caused by variable conflicts.

```javascript
var x = 10;
{
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x); // 2 - Inside this block, x is 2
}
console.log(x); // 10 - Outside the block, x is back to 10
```

In this example, you can see that `let` allows us to have two variables with the same name in different parts of the code without them interfering with each other. This is especially useful in large and complex projects where there might be many variables with different scopes.

## `const` Keyword in JavaScript

### 2. When should we use `const`, and how is it different from `let`?
The `const` keyword is used to define variables that shouldn't change their value. These variables remain constant after being initialized, and you can't assign a new value to them. However, if `const` is used for an object or an array, you can still change the contents of the object or array, but you can't assign the variable to a different object or array.

This feature prevents unintended changes to variables that are meant to stay constant. `const` is especially useful for defining constants like fixed parameters, settings, and other things that shouldn't change.

```javascript
const x = 10;
{
  const x = 2;
  console.log(x); // 2 - Inside this block, x is 2
}
console.log(x); // 10 - Outside the block, x is still 10
```

This example shows that with `const`, you can define variables that remain constant within their block scope, which makes your code more stable and helps prevent potential errors.

## Arrow Functions

### 3. What are Arrow Functions, and what advantages do they have over traditional functions?
Arrow Functions are a new, simpler way to write functions in JavaScript. Because of their concise syntax, they make the code shorter and more readable. Unlike traditional functions, Arrow Functions don't require the `function` keyword and the `return` keyword, allowing you to write simpler code without these keywords.

One of the main features of Arrow Functions is that they inherit `this` from the enclosing scope, meaning you don't need to keep track of `this` in temporary variables anymore. However, because of this feature, Arrow Functions are not suitable for use as methods of objects.

```javascript
// Regular function in ES5
var x = function(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

// Arrow function in ES6
const x = (x, y) => x * y;
```

This example shows how Arrow Functions can replace traditional functions and simplify coding. Arrow Functions are ideal for things like callbacks, short and simple functions, and situations where quick and readable coding is needed.

## Object Destructuring

### 4. How does Object Destructuring work, and why is it useful?
Object Destructuring is a handy way to extract values from an object and assign them to separate variables. Instead of having to assign each object property to variables manually, you can use destructuring to do this quickly and easily.

This feature is especially useful when working with complex objects that have multiple properties, making the code shorter and more readable.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

let { firstName, age } = person;
console.log(firstName); // 'John'
console.log(age); // 50
```

In this example, the `firstName` and `age` properties are extracted from the `person` object and assigned to separate variables. This method is particularly useful when you want to extract only some of the properties from an object and don't need the others.

## Array Destructuring

### 5. What is Array Destructuring, and when is it useful?
Array Destructuring is a convenient way to extract values from arrays and assign them to variables. Instead of manually accessing each array element and assigning them to variables, you can do this with a single statement.

This feature is especially useful when working with large or complex arrays where you only want to access a few elements, making the code more concise and readable.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

let [fruit1, fruit2] = fruits;
console.log(fruit1); // 'Banana'
console.log(fruit2); // 'Orange'
```

In this example, the first two elements of the `fruits` array are assigned to the variables `fruit1` and `fruit2`. Array Destructuring is useful when you need quick and simple access to a few elements of an array.

## Spread Operator

### 6. What is the `Spread` operator, and why was it added to JavaScript?
The `...` operator, known as the `Spread` operator, is a powerful feature in ES6 that allows you to spread out elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into a new array or function. This operator helps you concatenate arrays, copy them, or even pass elements of an array as arguments to a function.

This feature simplifies and cleans up code, making operations like merging, copying, or passing arguments easier to implement.

```javascript
const q1 = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"];
const q2 = ["Apr", "May", "Jun"];
const q3 = ["Jul", "Aug", "Sep"];
const q4 = ["Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];

const year = [...q1, ...q2, ...q3, ...q4];
console.log(year); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
```

In this example, the `Spread` operator is used to combine four arrays into a new array called `year`. This operator is particularly useful for coding scenarios that require merging data or passing arguments.

## For/of Loop

### 7. What is the `for/of` loop, and what are its uses?
The `for/of` loop is a new way to iterate over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, and sets) in JavaScript, allowing you to loop through their values easily. Unlike `for/in`, which iterates over keys or indexes, `for/of` iterates directly over values, making your code more readable and concise.

This loop is particularly useful for working with data that is iterable, like arrays and strings.

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
let text = "";

for (let x of cars) {
  text += x + " ";
}
console.log(text); // 'BMW Volvo Mini '
```

In this example, the `for/of` loop iterates over the elements of the `cars` array and adds each value to the `text` variable. This loop lets you work directly with values without dealing with indexes, simplifying your code.

## `Map` Object

### 8. What is a `Map` object, and what are its uses?
A `Map` object is a new data type in JavaScript that allows you to use any object as a key and access its associated values. Unlike regular objects that only use strings as keys, `Map` can accept any data type as a key.

This feature is particularly useful when you need to store data using unconventional keys (like objects or arrays) and gives you more precise control over your data.

```javascript
const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);

console.log(fruits.get("apples")); // 500
```

In this example, `Map` allows you to store data as key-value pairs and access them using the `get` method. This data type is ideal for managing collections of data that require non-simple keys.

## `Set` Object

### 9. What is a `Set` object, and how is it different from arrays?
A `Set` object is a new data type in JavaScript that lets you store a collection of unique values (no duplicates). Unlike arrays, which can have duplicate values, a `Set` only keeps unique values. This feature is particularly useful when you need to store a collection of values without duplicates.

```javascript
const letters = new Set();

letters.add("a");
letters.add("b");
letters.add("c");
letters.add("a"); // This value won't be added again because it already exists

console.log(letters.size); // 3
```

In this example, `Set` allows you to add values sequentially and prevent duplicate values from being stored. `Set` is particularly useful when you need to manage unique values and want to avoid the complexity of checking for duplicates.

## Classes in JavaScript

### 10. What are classes in JavaScript, and how

 do you use them?
Classes in JavaScript act as templates for creating similar objects. This feature allows you to define more complex structures like objects with specific methods and properties. Classes have a simpler and more readable syntax than constructor functions, making your code better organized.

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

const myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
const myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
```

In this example, a class named `Car` is defined with two properties, `name` and `year`. Using this class, you can easily create multiple objects of type `Car` and assign different values to them. Classes are particularly useful in applications that require defining multiple instances of a type, making your code more organized and readable.

## Promises in JavaScript

### 11. What are Promises, and how do they help manage asynchronous code?
Promises in JavaScript help you work with asynchronous code, like server requests, more simply and predictably. A `Promise` represents an asynchronous operation and its eventual outcome. When you define a `Promise`, you can specify what happens when the operation completes (whether successful or not).

This feature allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that's easier to read and manage.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(function() { resolve("I love You !!"); }, 3000);
});

myPromise.then(function(value) {
  console.log(value); // After 3 seconds, the message "I love You !!" is displayed
});
```

In this example, a `Promise` is defined that returns a message after 3 seconds. Using `then`, you can specify what to do when the `Promise` resolves. This feature is especially useful for managing asynchronous operations that might take time.

## `Symbol` Data Type

### 12. What is the `Symbol` data type, and when is it used?
The `Symbol` data type is a new type in JavaScript used to create unique and non-repeatable identifiers. `Symbols` are particularly useful when you need to prevent variable or property name conflicts in your code, as each `Symbol` is always unique. Even if you create two `Symbols` with the same description, they will still be different.

This feature is very useful for preventing issues like name conflicts in large projects or when multiple people are working on a project.

```javascript
let id = Symbol('id');
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

person[id] = 140353;
console.log(person[id]); // 140353
```

In this example, a `Symbol` named `id` is created and used as a key in the `person` object. This ensures that the `id` key does not conflict with any other property in the object and always remains unique.

## Default Parameters in Functions

### 13. How do default parameters in functions work, and what are their benefits?
Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters. This means if a parameter is not specified when calling the function, the function will use the default value. This feature simplifies writing code and prevents errors caused by forgetting to provide parameter values.

```javascript
function myFunction(x, y = 10) {
  return x + y;
}

console.log(myFunction(5)); // 15
```

In this example, the `myFunction` function has a `y` parameter with a default value of 10. If no value is specified for `y` when calling the function, the function automatically uses 10. This feature is especially useful in situations where a function requires many parameters, making coding more flexible.

## Rest Parameter in Functions

### 14. What is the Rest parameter, and what is its use?
The `Rest` parameter (`...`) is a simple way to define functions that take an unspecified number of arguments. With this parameter, you can take all the additional arguments as an array and work with them. This feature is particularly useful when you don't know exactly how many arguments a function will receive.

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let arg of args) sum += arg;
  return sum;
}

console.log(sum(4, 9, 16, 25, 29, 100, 66, 77)); // 326
```

In this example, the `sum` function can take any number of arguments and processes them all as an array. This feature is particularly useful for functions that need to work with a variable number of arguments.

## `String.includes` Method

### 15. How does the `includes` method help you check strings?
The `includes` method was added to strings to easily check if a specific substring exists in a larger string. This method returns a Boolean (`true` or `false`) and is very useful for quick searches within strings.

This method is especially helpful when you need to check if a specific word or phrase exists in a larger text.

```javascript
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
console.log(text.includes("world")); // true
```

In this example, `includes` checks if the word `world` exists in the `text` string and returns `true` or `false` based on the result. This method helps you easily check the content of strings with simple and readable code.

## `String.startsWith` Method

### 16. How can you check if a string starts with a specific word?
The `startsWith` method is a simple way to check if a string starts with a specific substring. If the string starts with that substring, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This method is useful when you need to check the content of a string.

```javascript
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
console.log(text.startsWith("Hello")); // true
```

In this example, `startsWith` checks if the `text` string starts with `Hello`. This feature is handy when you need to verify that a string begins with a specific word or phrase.

## `String.endsWith` Method

### 17. How can you check if a string ends with a specific word?
The `endsWith` method is a simple way to check if a string ends with a specific substring. If the string ends with that substring, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This method is useful for quickly checking the end of strings.

```javascript
let text = "John Doe";
console.log(text.endsWith("Doe")); // true
```

In this example, `endsWith` checks if the `text` string ends with `Doe`. This method is especially useful when you need to ensure a string ends in a specific way.

## `Array.entries` Method

### 18. What is the `entries` method, and how can you use it to iterate over arrays?
The `entries` method is a new way to iterate over arrays in JavaScript that allows you to loop through key-value pairs (i.e., index and value). This method returns an iterable object that you can use in a `for/of` loop to access each array element and its corresponding index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
const f = fruits.entries();

for (let x of f) {
  console.log(x);
}
/* Output:
[0, "Banana"]
[1, "Orange"]
[2, "Apple"]
[3, "Mango"]
*/
```

In this example, `entries` returns an iterable object of the `fruits` array that contains index-value pairs. This feature lets you access both the values and the indices in a loop simultaneously.

## `Array.from` Method

### 19. What is the `Array.from` method, and how does it help you convert different objects into arrays?
The `Array.from` method is a powerful feature in ES6 that lets you convert any array-like object (like `NodeList` or strings) or any iterable object into a real array. This feature is handy when working with objects that aren't arrays but want to use array functionalities on them.

```javascript
const arr = Array.from("ABCDEFG");
console.log(arr); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']
```

In this example, `Array.from` converts the string `ABCDEFG` into an array of letters. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to convert objects into arrays to use array methods.

## `Array.keys` Method

### 20. How can you use `keys` to get the indexes of an array?
The `keys` method is a new way to get the indexes of an array in JavaScript. This method returns an iterable object containing the array's keys (indexes). With this method, you can easily loop through the indexes of an array and access them.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
const keys = fruits.keys();

for (let key of keys) {
  console.log(key);
}
/* Output:
0
1
2
3
*/
```

In this example, `keys` returns the indexes of the `fruits` array, and the `for/of` loop iterates over these indexes. This method helps you easily access the array's indexes without needing to use more complex loops.

## `Array.find` Method

### 21. How can you use `find` to locate the first element that matches a specific condition in an array?
The `find` method is a powerful feature in ES6 that allows you to find and return the first element of

 an array that meets a specific condition. This method takes a function as an argument, which is executed for each array element, and returns the first element that satisfies the condition.

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let first = numbers.find(function(value) {
  return value > 18;
});
console.log(first); // 25
```

In this example, `find` locates and returns the first number in the `numbers` array that is greater than 18. This method is especially useful for quick searches in arrays and finding the first element that meets a specific condition.

## `Array.findIndex` Method

### 22. How can you use `findIndex` to locate the index of the first element that matches a specific condition?
The `findIndex` method works similarly to `find`, but instead of returning the value, it returns the index of the first element that meets a specific condition. This method is useful when you need to know the index of the first element that matches a specific condition.

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let firstIndex = numbers.findIndex(function(value) {
  return value > 18;
});
console.log(firstIndex); // 3
```

In this example, `findIndex` locates and returns the index of the first number in the `numbers` array that is greater than 18. This method is particularly useful for situations where you need to know the position of a specific element.

## New Math Methods

### 23. What new methods have been added to the Math object in ES6, and what are their uses?
Several new methods have been added to the Math object in ES6 for specific calculations. These methods include `Math.trunc`, `Math.sign`, `Math.cbrt`, `Math.log2`, and `Math.log10`. Each of these methods is designed for specific mathematical operations and helps you perform more complex calculations more easily.

- `Math.trunc(x)` returns the integer part of the number `x`, removing the fractional part.
- `Math.sign(x)` indicates whether `x` is negative, positive, or zero.
- `Math.cbrt(x)` calculates the cube root of the number `x`.
- `Math.log2(x)` returns the logarithm of `x` to the base 2.
- `Math.log10(x)` calculates the logarithm of `x` to the base 10.

```javascript
console.log(Math.trunc(4.9)); // 4
console.log(Math.sign(-4)); // -1
console.log(Math.cbrt(8)); // 2
console.log(Math.log2(8)); // 3
console.log(Math.log10(100)); // 2
```

These examples use various `Math` methods for mathematical calculations. These methods are particularly useful when you need to perform specific calculations in JavaScript, making the code simpler.

## New Number Features

### 24. What new features have been added to the Number object, and how can you use them?
In ES6, new features have been added to the Number object to help you work with numbers more precisely. These features include `Number.EPSILON`, `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, `Number.isInteger`, and `Number.isSafeInteger`.

- `Number.EPSILON` returns the smallest difference between two floating-point numbers in JavaScript.
- `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` specifies the smallest safe integer that can be accurately represented.
- `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` specifies the largest safe integer that can be accurately represented.
- `Number.isInteger(x)` checks if `x` is an integer.
- `Number.isSafeInteger(x)` checks if `x` is a safe integer.

```javascript
console.log(Number.EPSILON); // 2.220446049250313e-16
console.log(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER); // -9007199254740991
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991
console.log(Number.isInteger(10)); // true
console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(12345678901234567890)); // false
```

These features are particularly useful for working with numbers and preventing computational errors in JavaScript.

## New Global Methods

### 25. What new global methods have been added in ES6, and what are their uses?
In ES6, two new global methods have been added: `isFinite` and `isNaN`. These methods help you easily check if a value is a valid number.

- `isFinite(x)` checks if `x` is a finite number (i.e., not `Infinity` or `NaN`).
- `isNaN(x)` checks if `x` is a `NaN` (Not a Number).

```javascript
console.log(isFinite(10/0)); // false
console.log(isFinite(10/1)); // true
console.log(isNaN("Hello")); // true
```

These methods help you easily work with numbers and special values in JavaScript and prevent computational errors.

## Modules in JavaScript

### 26. How do modules work in JavaScript, and what are their benefits?
Modules are an important feature in ES6 that allow you to divide code into smaller, separate parts and manage these parts as independent modules. This feature helps you eliminate code repetition and manage your projects more efficiently.

In JavaScript, modules can be imported in two ways:

**Importing from named exports**: This type of import allows you to import specific values from a module.
   ```javascript
   import { name, age } from "./person.js";
   ```

**Importing from default exports**: This type of import allows you to import a default value from a module.
   ```javascript
   import message from "./message.js";
   ```

Modules help you write cleaner, more organized code and prevent code duplication. This feature is particularly useful for large projects and makes maintaining and developing your code easier.

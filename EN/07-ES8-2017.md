# ES8-2017 Questions

## String Padding in JavaScript

### 1. How does String Padding work in JavaScript, and what are its uses?
In ES8, two new methods, `padStart` and `padEnd`, were added to strings that let you pad a string from the beginning or the end with other characters to reach a specified length. These methods are especially useful when you want to format a string in a particular way, like adding leading zeros to a number for better display.

```javascript
const str = '5';
console.log(str.padStart(3, '0')); // '005' - padding from the start
console.log(str.padEnd(3, '0')); // '500' - padding from the end
```

In this example, `padStart` pads the string `5` from the start with `0` to reach a length of 3, and `padEnd` does the same from the end. This feature is useful for situations where you need specific formatting, such as displaying fixed-length numbers or product codes.

## `Object.entries` Method

### 2. What does the `Object.entries` method do in JavaScript, and how does it work?
The `Object.entries` method was introduced in ES8, allowing you to convert an object into an array of key-value pairs. This method returns all the enumerable properties of an object as an array of arrays, each containing a key and a value.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(Object.entries(obj)); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]
```

In this example, `Object.entries` converts the properties of the object `obj` into an array of key-value pairs. This method is especially useful when you need to convert an object into a more processable format, like arrays.

## `Object.values` Method

### 3. What are the benefits of the `Object.values` method, and how is it used?
The `Object.values` method was added in ES8, allowing you to return only the values of an object's properties as an array. This method works similarly to `Object.entries` but returns only the values instead of key-value pairs.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(Object.values(obj)); // [1, 2, 3]
```

In this example, `Object.values` returns the values of the properties of the object `obj` as an array. This method is useful when you only need the values and not the keys, such as when you want to perform a specific operation on all the values of an object.

## `async/await` Syntax

### 4. How does the `async/await` syntax work in JavaScript, and what are its advantages?
In ES8, a new syntax called `async/await` was introduced, making it much simpler and easier to understand when working with asynchronous code. Using `async/await`, you can write code that looks like it's synchronous, but it actually runs asynchronously. Functions defined with `async` return a `Promise`, and `await` makes the code wait until that `Promise` is either resolved or rejected.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}

fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
```

In this example, `fetchData` is an asynchronous function that waits with `await` until the data is returned from the API and then processes it. This syntax helps you write asynchronous code in a way that is easier to read and maintain without needing to use long chains of `then`.

## Trailing Commas in Functions

### 5. What is the use of trailing commas in function parameter lists and function calls?
In ES8, the ability to use trailing commas in function parameter lists and function calls was introduced. This feature is especially useful when you want to modify your code over time because you don't need to change the previous line when adding new parameters. It helps with code readability and makes comparing code changes easier.

```javascript
function sum(a, b, c,) {
    return a + b + c;
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3,)); // 6
```

In this example, a trailing comma is used at the end of the parameter list and arguments. These commas don't affect code execution but help keep your code cleaner and make managing changes easier.

## `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` Method

### 6. What information does the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` method provide, and how can it be used?
The `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` method was introduced in ES8, allowing you to return all property descriptors of an object as a new object. These descriptors include information like whether the property is writable, enumerable, and configurable.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, get b() { return 2; } };
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));
/* Output:
{
  a: { value: 1, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true },
  b: {
    get: [Function: get b],
    set: undefined,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
  }
}
*/
```

In this example, `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` returns all the information about the properties of the object `obj`, including whether those properties are changeable. This method is very useful when you need to know the complete details of an object's properties. This information can help you manage objects more advanced, such as creating more precise copies or making controlled changes to properties.

## `Object.groupBy` Method

### 1. What does the `Object.groupBy` method do, and what are its applications?
> The `Object.groupBy` method is a new feature that allows you to group elements of an array of objects based on the values returned by a callback function. This method does not modify the original object; instead, it returns a new object with elements grouped into different categories. This feature is particularly useful when you want to group data dynamically, like grouping fruits based on their quantity.

```javascript
const fruits = [
  { name: "apples", quantity: 300 },
  { name: "bananas", quantity: 500 },
  { name: "oranges", quantity: 200 },
  { name: "kiwi", quantity: 150 }
];

function myCallback({ quantity }) {
  return quantity > 200 ? "ok" : "low";
}

const result = Object.groupBy(fruits, myCallback);
console.log(result);
// Output:
// { ok: [ { name: 'apples', quantity: 300 }, { name: 'bananas', quantity: 500 } ],
//   low: [ { name: 'oranges', quantity: 200 }, { name: 'kiwi', quantity: 150 } ] }
```

> In this example, `Object.groupBy` categorizes the fruits into "ok" and "low" groups based on their quantities. This method is particularly useful for dynamically grouping data based on various criteria.

## `Map.groupBy` Method

### 2. How does `Map.groupBy` differ from `Object.groupBy`, and when is it better to use?
> The `Map.groupBy` method works similarly to `Object.groupBy`, but instead of returning a JavaScript object, it returns a `Map`. `Map` is more versatile because it can accept any data type as a key, making it more suitable for complex or non-string-based grouping.

```javascript
const fruits = [
  { name: "apples", quantity: 300 },
  { name: "bananas", quantity: 500 },
  { name: "oranges", quantity: 200 },
  { name: "kiwi", quantity: 150 }
];

function myCallback({ quantity }) {
  return quantity > 200 ? "ok" : "low";
}

const result = Map.groupBy(fruits, myCallback);
console.log(result);
// Output:
// Map(2) { 'ok' => [ { name: 'apples', quantity: 300 }, { name: 'bananas', quantity: 500 } ],
//          'low' => [ { name: 'oranges', quantity: 200 }, { name: 'kiwi', quantity: 150 } ] }
```

> In this example, `Map.groupBy` groups the data similarly to `Object.groupBy`, but the output is a `Map`. `Map` is beneficial when you need advanced features like maintaining the order of elements or using non-string keys.

## `Temporal.PlainDate` Feature

### 3. How can `Temporal.PlainDate` help manage dates, and why is it better than `Date`?
> The `Temporal.PlainDate` feature is one of the new tools for managing dates that offers more precision and capabilities compared to `Date`. It allows you to handle dates without worrying about the time of day, making it ideal for tasks like calendar calculations or scheduling specific dates.

```javascript
const date = new Temporal.PlainDate(2024, 5, 1);
console.log(date); // 2024-05-01
```

> In this example, `Temporal.PlainDate` creates a date without considering the time. This is useful when you only need the date and time is not important.

## `Temporal.PlainTime` Feature

### 4. What is the use of `Temporal.PlainTime`, and what advantages does it have over using `Date` for time management?
> The `Temporal.PlainTime` feature is used to manage times without the need for a date. It allows you to specify times with millisecond precision without worrying about time zones or dates. This feature is excellent for applications like timers or daily scheduling.

```javascript
const time = new Temporal.PlainTime(10, 30);
console.log(time); // 10:30:00
```

> In this example, `Temporal.PlainTime` creates a specific time without considering the date. This is great for when you only need to manage time and the date is irrelevant.

## `Temporal.PlainMonthDay` Feature

### 5. How can `Temporal.PlainMonthDay` be useful in managing special dates like birthdays or anniversaries?
> The `Temporal.PlainMonthDay` feature is used to manage dates that only include the month and day (like birthdays or anniversaries). This feature does not require a year and allows you to easily keep track of specific dates.

```javascript
const monthDay = new Temporal.PlainMonthDay(5, 1);
console.log(monthDay); // 05-01
```

> In this example, `Temporal.PlainMonthDay` creates a specific date that only includes the month and day. This feature is very useful for tasks that require managing dates without a year.

## `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` Feature

### 6. How does `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` assist in managing financial dates or monthly reports?
> The `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` feature is used to manage dates that include the year and month (like financial reports or monthly planning). This feature allows you to specify the year and month easily without worrying about the day.

```javascript
const yearMonth = new Temporal.PlainYearMonth(2024, 5);
console.log(yearMonth); // 2024-05
```

> In this example, `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` creates a date that only includes the year and month. This capability is very useful for managing monthly planning or financial reports.
